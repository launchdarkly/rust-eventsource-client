# eventsource-client

[![Run CI](https://github.com/launchdarkly/rust-eventsource-client/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/launchdarkly/rust-eventsource-client/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Client for the [Server-Sent Events] protocol (aka [EventSource]).

[Server-Sent Events]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html
[EventSource]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource

## Requirements

Requires tokio.

## Usage

Example that just prints the type of each event received:

```rust
use eventsource_client as es;

let mut client = es::ClientBuilder::for_url("https://example.com/stream")?
    .header("Authorization", "Basic username:password")?
    .build();

client
    .stream()
    .map_ok(|event| println!("got event: {:?}", event))
    .map_err(|err| eprintln!("error streaming events: {:?}", err));
```

(Some boilerplate omitted for clarity; see [examples directory] for complete,
working code.)

## Features

* tokio-based streaming client.
* Supports setting custom headers on the HTTP request (e.g. for endpoints
  requiring authorization).
* Retry for failed connections.
* Reconnection if connection is interrupted, with exponential backoff.

## Stability

Early stage release for feedback purposes. May contain bugs or performance
issues. API subject to change.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

This project aims to maintain compatibility with a Rust version that is at least six months old.

Version updates may occur more frequently than the policy guideline states if external forces require it. For example, a CVE in a downstream dependency requiring an MSRV bump would be considered an acceptable reason to violate the six month guideline.
